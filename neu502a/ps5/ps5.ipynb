    "## Part 1: The Two-Step Task\n",
    "In the following exercises, we will be analyzing behavior from the two-step task [(Daw et al., 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627311001255). The two-step task is a two-stage Markov decision task in which, on each trial, an initial choice between two options leads probabilistically to either of two, second-stage states. In turn, these second states require an additional two-option choice, each of which associated with a different chance of delivering a monetary reward. The choice of one first-stage option led predominantly (70% of the time) to an associated one of the two second-stage states, and this relationship was fixed throughout the experiment. However, to incentivize subjects to continue learning throughout the task, the chances of payoff associated with the four second-stage options were changed slowly and independently, according to Gaussian random walks. A schematic representation of the two-step task is provided below.\n",

The challenge for someone completing the two-step task is to learn the value of each state-action pair, $(S,A)$, so as to maximize reward over time.

    "### SARSA-TD(0)\n",
    "Temporal difference (TD) learning describes a class of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms which learn by sampling from the environment and performing updates based on the observed results. TD learning models can be distinguished by whether they are **on-policy** or **off-policy**, where the former describes updates based on the values of the actions taken and the latter describes updates based on the maximum value that could have been observed. We will consider a class of on-policy TD learning models, the *SARSA model*, which updates $Q$-values according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta =  R + Q(s',a') - Q(s,a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\eta \\delta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation corresponds to the *reward prediction error*, $\\delta$, where $Q(s,a)$ is expected value of the current state-action pair; $Q(s',a')$ is the expected value of the next state-action pair; and $R$ is the reward observed transitioning from $s \\rightarrow s'$. The expected value estimate $Q(s,a)$ is updated according to the reward prediction error, $\\delta$, and the the learning rate, $\\eta \\in [0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the formulas above, we can write the update rules for the states of the two-step task:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Terminal states ($S_2, S_3$)**: By definition, there is no next state-action pair at a terminal state. Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta = R - Q(s,a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \\eta \\delta $$\n",

    "    \n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \\eta \\delta $$\n",

    "One way to improve on this rule is to include a discounting factor, $\\gamma$, which discounts the value of future rewards:\n",

    "We can more efficiently express the model above by employing **eligibility traces**, which provide a algorithmic mechanism for addressing the credit-assignment problem. With eligibility traces, we will have an additional set of trace estimates $E$ of the same size as $Q$. In contrast to $Q$-values, however, $E$-values are initialized to zero at the start of each trial and updated within trials. The update rule for the values of $E$ at each step within a trial is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The eligibility trace is then used to simultaneously update the $Q$-table at the end of a trial (i.e. the receipt of reward) according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \\eta \\delta e(s,a) $$\n",

    "## Part 4: Cliff Walking\n",
    "Consider the grid world shown below. This is a standard undiscounted, episodic task, with start and goal states, and the usual actions causing movement up, down, right, and left. Reward is -1 on all transitions except those into the region marked “The Cliff.” Stepping into this region incurs a reward of -100 and sends the agent instantly back to the start.\n",

    "\n",
    "Two paths are marked: an optimal path which incurs the least costs on the way to the goal, and a roundabout (but safe) path that walks farthest from the cliff.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Which algorithm, SARSA or $Q$-learning, would learn either path, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "> SARSA would learn the safe path and $Q$-learning would learn the optimal path. $Q$-learning updates on the best possible action, regardless of what *actually* occurred (i.e. it is an off-policy learning rule). Thus, it would not update its expected values according to the worst possible outcome (i.e. falling off the cliff) but only the most optimal outcome (i.e. traversing along it). By contrast, SARSA is an on-policy learning rule and would update to reflect the severe penalty for falling off the cliff.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) When behaving according to softmax of the learned $Q$-values, which path would an agent prefer? (Think about parameter $\\beta$ and the stability of the environment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> When choosing a path according to the softmax of the learned $Q$-values, the chosen path will reflect the inverse temperature $\\beta$. When $\\beta$ is low and choice is relatively stochastic, then the safe path is preferable (i.e. put distance between the agent and cliff in case of randomly choosing the cliff). When $\\beta$ is high and choice is relatively deterministic, then the optimal path is preferable since the probability of choosing a path off the cliff is low. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The chosen path will also reflect the environment. When the environment is unstable and transitions probabilistic, then the safe path is preferable (i.e. put distance between the agent and cliff in case of accidentally transitioning off the path and off the cliff). When the environment is stable and transitions deterministic, then the optimal path is preferable since the probability of transitioning off the cliff are low.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Can you suggest why on-policy methods might be superior for learning real-world motor behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In training motor actions, the goal is to specifically learn the value of particular motor sequences. This requires precise information about the value of each state-action pair learned from the action actually taken (on-policy), not the best possible action that might have been (off-policy). In other words, for motor learning we want precise value information for transitioning between state-action pairs."
